Justification should specify that without replacing the green cube the probability for the blue cube to be drawn second increases from 1/5 to 5/24; that the fraction 5/24 is greater than 1/5; and that there are fewer cubes in the box after the green cube is removed, so all cubes have a greater likelihood of being chosen on the second draw, or that the compound probability without replacing the green cube is 1/15, which is greater than 8/125. Accept correct models, such as tree diagrams or tables that clearly illustrate the increased likelihood and/or a clear comparison of equations and solutions representing the two events.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>"
