              "text": "<h1>Epilogue from The Secret of the Yellow Death: A True Story of Medical Sleuthing </h1><h2>by Suzanne Jurmain</h2><p>[1] After December 31, 1900, the battle against yellow fever continued.&nbsp;</p><p>[2] As soon as the results of the Reed team’s work were known, public health officials <u>launched </u>an all-out <u>campaign </u>against the mosquitoes that carried the disease. In the United States and Cuba a <u>virtual </u>army of sanitation workers used poison <u>fumes </u>to kill mosquitoes that lurked in buildings and wiped out eggs by spraying oil on the pools, ponds, puddles, and containers of still water where the insects liked to breed. Killing the mosquitoes killed the yellow fever germs the insects carried, and by the end of 1901 there were no cases of the illness in Havana, Cuba. By 1905 the United States was free of the disease. And between 1902 and 1914—thanks to an <u>effective </u>battle against germ-bearing mosquitoes in Central America—U.S. workers were able to safely build the Panama Canal.&nbsp;</p><p>[3] As the threat of yellow fever gradually <u>receded</u>, people <u>showered </u>Dr. Finlay and the Reed team scientists with honors, thanks, and praise. Statues of Carlos Finlay were set up in Cuba. A medical <u>society </u>and an American elementary school were named after him; and—though he never won—Dr. Finlay was <u>nominated </u>for one of science’s greatest awards, the Nobel Prize in medicine, three times before his death in 1915.&nbsp;</p><p>[4] Although Walter Reed died of <u>appendicitis </u>in 1902, soon after his return from Cuba, he, too, became a hero. Researchers <u>adopted </u>Reed’s belief that all volunteers in scientific experiments should be <u>fully informed</u> of all the risks. In 1909 the American government named the Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., after the team’s chief investigator. And in 1929, Congress awarded all the American volunteer scientists (including Dr. Jesse Lazear) one of the nation’s highest honors, the Congressional Gold Medal, for their work on yellow fever.&nbsp;</p><p>[5] But while people and governments were honoring past work on the illness, twentieth-century scientists were looking for new ways to fight the terrible disease. Until his death in 1907, Dr. James Carroll continued to search for the yellow fever germ. Although his efforts were unsuccessful, Carroll <u>ultimately </u>came to believe that the disease is caused by a microbe that is much smaller than bacteria. Dr. Aristides Agramonte, who taught bacteriology in both the United States and Cuba before his death in 1931, tended to agree. And by 1927 scientists knew that the disease was produced by a virus—an extremely tiny, extremely simple <u>microorganism </u>that is so much smaller than bacteria, it cannot be seen with an ordinary microscope.&nbsp;</p><p>[6] Once scientists had identified the virus, the next step was to make a vaccine that would prevent people from getting the disease. That, however, proved difficult. Although researchers worked on the problem, progress was slow until scientists discovered two facts that the Reed team had not known. In the late 1920s and early 1930s researchers learned that some types of monkeys could actually get yellow fever and that, under special conditions, the virus could sometimes be grown inside the bodies of ordinary white laboratory mice. Using animals made experimental work much easier; and, finally, in 1936, Dr. Max Theiler developed a vaccine that safely kept humans from getting the disease.&nbsp;</p><p>[7] Research also continued on other <u>fronts</u>; and, during the twentieth century, scientists answered many of the questions about the cause and spread of yellow fever that had puzzled earlier investigators. Researchers learned that an infected female mosquito can pass the virus on to all her offspring through her eggs. They found that the yellow fever virus actually enters every cell of an infected mosquito’s body. And they discovered that a female mosquito transmits the disease by dripping infected <u>saliva </u>into the wound while she is sucking blood.&nbsp;</p><p>[8] Additional investigation uncovered more facts, and scientists soon realized that a mosquito must bite a yellow fever patient in the first three days of the illness in order to pick up the infection. They also learned that the virus may have to remain in the insect’s body for as much as seventeen days before the bug can infect a person with the disease. To scientists, this information was particularly interesting because it explained why some of the Reed team’s volunteers did not come down with yellow fever after being bitten. In some cases, it was clear that the team’s mosquitoes weren’t carrying the germ because they hadn’t bitten yellow fever victims during the <u>crucial </u>three-day <u>infectious </u>period at the beginning of the illness. In other instances, volunteers did not get sick because the germ was not allowed to stay inside the <u>host </u>mosquito long enough.&nbsp;</p><p>[9] Today, researchers believe that the yellow fever virus <u>originated in</u> West Africa and was brought to the Americas by slave ships carrying infected insects. They also know that the germ still lurks in the <u>dense </u>jungles of Africa and South America, where it infects monkeys and is carried by mosquitoes who transmit it to endless <u>generations </u>of offspring through their eggs.&nbsp;</p><p>[10] Vaccination programs and mosquito <u>extermination </u>programs have slowed the spread of yellow fever, but it is impossible to completely eliminate the virus. Many poor countries cannot afford to pay for the lifesaving vaccine, and some people now believe that <u>insecticides </u>should not be used to kill mosquitoes because these poisons may damage the environment.</p><p>[11] At this moment there is still no cure for yellow fever, and deadly outbreaks of the disease can still occur. In the early 1960s, 30,000 people died during a yellow fever epidemic in Ethiopia. The illness continues to <u>plague </u>people in parts of Africa and South America. Only three companies—in France, Brazil, and Senegal—now <u>rank </u>as approved yellow fever vaccine producers and <u>demand </u>is sometimes high. When the government of Paraguay failed to provide enough vaccine during a 2008 outbreak of the fever, desperate people <u>mobbed </u>clinics, yelling, “Vaccinations! Vaccinations!”&nbsp;</p><p>[12] In the twenty-first century yellow fever is still one of the many diseases that <u>threaten </u>humans, and doctors are still trying to develop new ways to combat the illness. Some, but not all, <u>modern </u>research can be done with laboratory animals. For that reason, in countries around the world, many scientists and many ordinary people—like those who worked with Reed—are now knowingly risking possible illness, injury, or even death in order to voluntarily participate in experiments that test new vaccines, new treatments, new medical <u>techniques</u>, and new drugs that may one day benefit <u>humanity</u>.</p><p><u>____________________________</u></p><h2><strong>Glossary</strong> </h2><p><strong>adopted</strong>–took on </p><p><strong>appendicitis</strong>–disease of the appendix </p><p><strong>campaign</strong>–set of organized actions </p><p><strong>crucial</strong>–very important </p><p><strong>demand</strong>–need </p><p><strong>dense</strong>–thick </p><p><strong>effective</strong>–successful </p><p><strong>extermination</strong>–killing </p><p><strong>fronts</strong>–areas fully </p><p><strong>informed</strong>–made completely aware </p><p><strong>fumes</strong>–gasses </p><p><strong>generations</strong>–group of living things born in the same period </p><p><strong>host</strong>–living thing in which something else lives </p><p><strong>humanity</strong>–all humans </p><p><strong>infectious</strong>–contagious </p><p><strong>insecticides</strong>–insect poison </p><p><strong>launched</strong>–began </p><p><strong>microorganism</strong>–one-celled living thing </p><p><strong>mobbed</strong>–crowded around </p><p><strong>modern</strong>–of present or recent times </p><p><strong>nominated</strong>–suggested for a particular position or honor </p><p><strong>originated</strong> <strong>in</strong>–came from </p><p><strong>plague</strong>–harm </p><p><strong>rank</strong>–stand </p><p><strong>receded</strong>–shrunk </p><p><strong>saliva</strong>–spit </p><p><strong>showered</strong>–gave a lot to </p><p><strong>society</strong>–group</p><p><strong>techniques</strong>–ways of doing something </p><p><strong>threaten</strong>–put in danger </p><p><strong>ultimately</strong>–in the end </p><p><strong>virtual</strong>–almost</p>",

At the end of the task, you will be asked to write an analytical essay comparing the points of view in the texts.</strong></p><p>Read the passage from “Understanding Insects as Friends or Foes.” Then answer the questions.</p><p>from “Understanding Insects as Friends or Foes”</p><p><em>by </em>Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development</p><ol><li><p>Insects can be found nearly everywhere. Some insects are helpful to people. Other insects are harmful and cause damage to trees and crops. Farmers and gardeners need to know which insects are friends and which are not. Insects can carry diseases, damage crops, make fruits and vegetables look bad and can even destroy entire crops, which limits the amount of food available for people and animals to eat. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a pest management system that focuses on managing pests with the least possible impact on people, property, and the environment. Farmers use tools like crop rotation, sprays or good bugs to help their crops. Using traps, scouting and identifying insects, and controlling bugs are all important tools for farmers to use.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Farmers/Growers use:</strong></p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Chemical crop sprays or powders</strong>—farmers use as little as needed, to protect the environment and to protect the water and food supplies. Pesticide applications are a useful tool, when applied according to label instructions by registered and certified pesticide applicators.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Crop Rotation</strong>—farmers do not grow the same crop every year, but instead rotate which crops they plant in each field. For instance, one year a farmer may grow a field of corn. The next year, the farmer may grow alfalfa hay in that field. Farmers do this because certain bugs like certain crops. By growing different crops year after year, bugs will leave. Crop rotation is a common practice on sloping soils because of its potential for saving soil. Rotation also reduces fertilizer needs, because alfalfa and other legumes replace some of the nitrogen corn and other grain crops remove. With crop rotation, pesticide costs may be reduced by naturally breaking the cycles of weeds, insects and diseases. As added benefits, grass and legumes in a rotation protect water quality by preventing excess nutrients or chemicals from entering water supplies; meadow or small grains cut soil erosion dramatically; and crop rotations add diversity to a farming operation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Good Insects</strong>—farmers also use “good” or beneficial insects to protect their crops and get rid of harmful insects. Some insects can do a lot of damage to crops and orchards. An insect’s worst enemies are other insects. Of the millions of insects that eat animals instead of plants, most feed on other insects. Using insects to control insects is called a “biocontrol” method. Biological control is the use of naturally occurring organisms that act as natural enemies to the pests in question. These approaches to pest management may be used to reduce pesticide use. The introduction and encouragement of natural predators is a highly effective method of controlling many bugs. Some quick biocontrol definitions: Pest—an unwanted insect or weed; Pathogen—bacterium or fungus that causes disease in a pest; Parasite—an insect that feeds in a living pest; and Predator—an insect that eats pests. When used effectively, biocontrol methods can be a safe and effective approach to pest management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scouting/Trapping</strong>—farmers must watch their fields or orchards closely. Farmers look on the leaves of the trees or plants for bugs. This is called scouting. To help find the insects, farmers use traps. When pests are found that could damage the crop, the farmer must choose the best way to get rid of the pest. Traps are hung in fruit trees, in greenhouses and on posts in fields for other crops. A scent, called a pheromone, is used inside the trap. This attracts the bugs to the trap. The trap is sticky inside, so when the bugs fly into the trap to smell the pheromone they get stuck. Killing adult bugs stops the cycle of egg laying or larval development and reduces pest populations. Sometimes farmers need help identifying the insects they find. They use a key, or guide. A key uses color, the number of legs or other things to determine what bug they have found.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"6\"><li><p>In addition to the pest management tools listed above, keeping things clean goes a long way toward reducing pest problems, especially indoor pests like cockroaches, ants and houseflies. Cleanliness is also important on farms for pest control, especially around feed piles and manure-prone areas.</p></li><li><p>The most important thing you can do to control bugs is to learn as much as you can about the life cycles and preventative treatments for bugs that are bugging you.</p></li></ol><p>Printed with permission of Michigan Farm Bureau.</p>",

A rainbow of flowers is a great way to add color to your yard. I have been adding to my garden for 16 years and have learned a lot about how to make it look terrific. You too can have a beautiful garden!</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>       Planting flower bulbs is an easy way to fill your garden with flowers. Flower bulbs are small, rounded plants that are resting before they start growing. They can be planted in the ground and will grow into flowering plants. I find that bulbs take very little work to plant. Just dig a hole, drop in your bulb, and cover with soil! Each type of bulb is a little different, but those are the basic steps.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>      It is best to make a plan before you start planting. Planning out your garden takes a little work. The work will pay off, though! Think about what time of year you want your flowers to bloom. Do you want them to look their best in the spring or summer? Make sure to plant your bulbs at the right time. Some bulbs need to be planted in the fall. Those are bulbs that need the cold temperatures of winter in order to grow. Other bulbs cannot stand the winter. Those bulbs should be planted in the spring.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>      The first year I grew a garden, I planted only short, purple flowers. How boring! Now I know, though, to plant flowers together that look different. In my opinion, a mix of a few colors in the same spot looks best. Also, plant tall flowers with shorter flowers. This will make your garden look more interesting. Another tip for getting your garden to stand out is to plant flowers in groups. That will look more natural than single flowers in a row.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>        If you follow some of my tips, you will be on your way to beautiful blooms!</p></div></div>",

He carried the heavy box down the hallway to the kitchen where he found his mother, father, and sister unpacking various gadgets. Samuel&#39;s family had sold their previous home and moved into this old Victorian-style house so his father could work at the local hospital. Samuel didn&#39;t relish the idea of moving at first, but now he thought this might not be such a bad place to call home. Additionally, school didn&#39;t start for another month, so Samuel and his sister, Catherine, would have time to explore their new neighborhood and meet other kids.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>After Samuel placed the cardboard box on the kitchen counter, his mother rushed over and started inspecting it.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;This box contains your great-grandmother&#39;s wedding china,&#34; Mom explained as she opened it. &#34;These dishes are very old and fragile, so I hope they survived the move.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>While his mother carefully examined each piece of china, Samuel asked his father what needed to be accomplished next.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;Well, you and Catherine can take the boxes of winter clothes up to the attic after lunch,&#34; Dad said as he put spices and canned goods away in the pantry. &#34;We&#39;ll also need to see if the previous owners left anything behind and clear it out.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Catherine let out a groan at the thought of spending the afternoon cleaning the attic.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;Come on, Catherine,&#34; Samuel said with a smile. &#34;Clearing out the attic might be fun! You never know what treasures might be hidden in this old house.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Catherine replied, &#34;You&#39;ve got your head in the clouds if you think we&#39;ll discover hidden treasures in this place. I think we&#39;re more likely to find a bunch of clutter.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>After lunch, Samuel and Catherine hauled several boxes to one of the guest rooms, where they could access the stairs to the attic. The attic was hot, and Catherine immediately felt like leaving the cramped space. They deposited the boxes in one corner of the large attic and then looked around to see what had been left behind.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">10</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Catherine let out a dramatic sigh when she reached the opposite end of the attic where several cardboard boxes were piled against the wall. Unfortunately, they would need to go through them all to see what was inside.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">11</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Samuel found a box of old books that were in good condition and could be taken to the local library. Catherine&#39;s mood improved immensely after finding a trunk filled with outdated clothes. Samuel could not keep a straight face when he saw her donning a hideous floral scarf and an enormous feathered hat. The clothes were spotless, so Catherine decided to donate them to the high school&#39;s drama department.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">12</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>After spending most of the afternoon sorting through boxes, Samuel had just about run out of steam when he heard Catherine let out a gasp of excitement.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">13</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;Samuel, take a look at this!&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">14</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>His sister was pointing at something, and Samuel peered over her shoulder to see a wooden box sitting on one of the rafters near the ceiling.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">15</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>He carefully dislodged the box from its resting place and set it on the attic floor. Samuel noticed that the locked box had the name &#34;Reynolds&#34; painted on one side and assumed this was the name of a family that once lived in the house.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">16</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;Let&#39;s try to open it and see if there really is treasure inside!&#34; Samuel exclaimed as he searched the rafter for the key that would unlock the mysteries inside the box.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">17</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;No, Samuel,&#34; Catherine said quickly. &#34;Imagine that this box contained Great&#8211;grandmother&#39;s wedding china or Dad&#39;s baseball card collection. You wouldn&#39;t want someone to look through it, would you?&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">18</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>After listening to Catherine, Samuel had a change of heart and abandoned his search for the missing key. When they finished their task, the siblings brought the wooden box downstairs to show their parents.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">19</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Samuel&#39;s mother immediately recognized the name on the box. &#34;This is the name of the woman who sold us this house,&#34; she explained. &#34;She inherited the home from her grandfather, but she didn&#39;t think that she could handle all the maintenance. Ms. Reynolds only lives a few blocks away, so we could return the box to her this evening.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">20</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>About half an hour later, Samuel, Catherine, and their mother stood on the steps of a small brick house. A woman with bright red hair answered the door and smiled after recognizing the children&#39;s mother. Their mother introduced Samuel and Catherine, and Ms. Reynolds ushered them all inside. Samuel held onto the box as everyone took seats around a small kitchen table. He carefully placed the box on the table and told Ms. Reynolds about their discovery. After listening, Ms. Reynolds abruptly left the kitchen. She returned a few moments later with an antique key in her hand. Samuel felt his heart begin to race as he waited for Ms. Reynolds to open the box and reveal what was inside.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">21</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Ms. Reynolds&#39;s face filled with emotion when she finally opened the lid.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">22</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;It&#39;s filled with old photographs and letters from my grandparents,&#34; Ms. Reynolds said in a quiet voice. &#34;I thought these were lost forever. I can&#39;t tell you what it means to me to have them back.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">23</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Realizing that they had uncovered a hidden treasure after all, Samuel smiled widely at his sister.</p></div></div>",

              "text": "<h3>It Could Save Your Life</h3><p class=\"kds-indent\">Look around you.  There is probably one in the room where you are sitting.  A red canister in a corner probably covered with dust.  It is a bright spot of color in the room.  It may seem useless.  But, it could save your life!<br /> </p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Fire extinguishers are made to remove one of three things present in a fire: intense heat, oxygen (or some other gas), or fuel.  They are made of metal and filled with water.  If it is not water, an extinguisher is filled with something that suffocates fire, like foam.  This material is forced out of the extinguisher like spray from a can.  A special valve keeps the gas from escaping from the extinguisher until the lever at the top is pressed.<br /> </p><p class=\"kds-indent\">You may have an extinguisher at home that is not filled with water.  It is essential that you have it inspected every six years.  Sometimes the gauge says the extinguisher has the right pressure and will work properly.  But, the gauge could be incorrect.  That is why an inspection is important.<br /> </p><p class=\"kds-indent\">If you ever need to use an extinguisher, remember to aim the spray of water or foam at the source of the fire.  Move the can in a back&#8211;and&#8211;forth motion, like you are sweeping.  Do not use a water&#8211;filled extinguisher for putting out electrical fires.  Use it for putting out wood or paper fires only.  Most fire extinguishers only have a small amount of substance in them.  It can be used up in seconds.  So, extinguishers are best for small fires that have not spread.  For large or fast&#8211;spreading fires, call 9&#8211;1&#8211;1 and go to a safe place.</p><p></p>",

Eating Italian food is one way that swimmer Tom Dolan gears up for a big race&#8212;along with making sure his inhaler is full.  Tom has a case of asthma that might prevent some people from walking down the street, but he has won two gold medals and has broken a world record.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Tom Dolan started swimming at age five, simply to prove that he could out-swim his older sister.  He has always been highly competitive; when he was a child, his dad could always get him to drink an extra glass of milk by filling two glasses and challenging Tom to a race.  At the age of eleven, he broke his arm and his mother told him to stop swimming until the cast was off.  Instead, Tom covered the cast with a foam casing and kept on swimming.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>When Tom was twelve, he was running on the playground and suddenly felt like he could not breathe.  He did not tell his parents until it happened a second time.  They took him straight to the doctor, who diagnosed him with allergies and asthma.  Tom was allergic to dust, mold, and pollen. Worst of all for a swimmer, he was sensitive to chlorine!</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Tom&#39;s asthma did not stop him from becoming a competitive swimmer in college though, nor did the fact that he was also diagnosed with exercise&#8211;induced asthma.  This meant that his asthma would get worse as he worked out more intensely.  Another doctor said he also had a condition called tracheal stenosis, a narrow windpipe.  Due to the tracheal stenosis and asthma, Tom could only take in about 10% as much oxygen as his competitors.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Despite his medical conditions, Tom continued to swim.  His best event was the 400&#8211;meter Individual Medley (IM), which consists of 100 meters each of four different strokes: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle.  Sometimes Tom blacked out during practice, but never during a race.  Even a collapse and subsequent hospitalization in Hawaii during his sophomore year in college did not stop Tom.  He had his eye on the Olympics.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 presented Tom with a special challenge.  The heat and humidity created sticky, heavy air that made it more difficult than usual for him to breathe.  Going into the last 50 meters of the 400&#8211;meter IM, Tom was 3/100<sup>ths</sup> of a second behind his toughest competition, Eric Namesnik, another American swimmer.  Tom pushed himself to the limit, beating Eric by 35/100<sup>ths</sup> of a second and setting a world record for the event.  He went on to win his second gold medal in the same event in Sydney in 2000.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Tom believes that he is a great swimmer because of, not in spite of, his medical problems.  He feels that his asthma taught him how to overcome adversity.  As he says, he feels like he is one step ahead, because &#34;I know that my body has gone through more stress and strain than anyone else in the pool.&#34;  And, quite possibly, more Italian food.</p></div></div>",

              "text": "<h3>The Sneaky Leprechaun</h3><p class=\"kds-indent\">One beautiful day while running through a garden, a young leprechaun named Pat came across a tall, stunning waterfall. He watched as the cool water glistened in the sunlight as it fell into the pool below. Just then, a rainbow appeared right before his eyes! &#34;Wow, I bet there is a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow!&#34; he said. Without another thought, Pat jumped onto the rainbow and slid all the way down to the pond, ending with a splash. Pat landed in the crystal clear water, but there was no gold to be seen. &#34;I was wrong, there is no gold here, but only I know that...&#34; Pat let out a conniving laugh as he headed back to see his brother, Lucky.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">&#34;Lucky, I found a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, come quick!&#34; Lucky was excited and quickly followed Pat back to the top of the waterfall.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">&#34;The gold is down there?&#34; asked Lucky.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">&#34;Yes, you must slide down the rainbow to see the pot of gold,&#34; replied Pat. Lucky glided down the rainbow, reached the water below with a loud plop, and eagerly looked around. As he did this, Pat laughed deviously. &#34;I can&#39;t believe you fell for that one! I tricked you, there is no gold!&#34; Pat laughed until he could barely breathe, but Lucky did not think it was a funny joke. Lucky walked away angrily, his clothes dripping wet.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">&#34;Pat, one day you will tell the truth and no one will believe you.&#34; he said in a low, disappointed tone.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Pat disregarded Lucky&#39;s comments and continued to play practical jokes on other leprechauns in the garden. A few weeks later, Pat came across an old, long wooden bridge. As he crossed it, he saw a colorful rainbow emerge from the bright blue sky. The rainbow led from the highest clouds all the way to the ground below the bridge. As he stared down from the bridge, Pat thought he saw something shining on the ground below. He gazed until his eyes fixed onto a bowl&#8211;like object filled with something. &#34;It is, that is a pot of gold!&#34; Pat looked around, frantically looking for a way to get down to the gold. It was a very far drop to the ground from where he stood on the old bridge, and he knew he needed help. As fast as he could, Pat ran home to get Lucky.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">When Pat told Lucky what he had discovered, Lucky replied &#34;No way, I am not falling for that again!&#34;</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Pat pleaded with Lucky to believe him. &#34;I promise I am telling the truth this time, there really is a pot of gold!&#34; Lucky still did not trust him. After what felt like hours, Lucky became so annoyed with Pat that he finally agreed to follow him to the old bridge. When they arrived, the beautiful rainbow was gone and to Pat&#39;s dismay, so was the pot of gold. Pat looked down in disappointment, but a moment later something shiny caught his eye. Something was stuck in the mud just a few feet from where he stood. He walked over, picked it up, and rinsed it off in the pond. &#34;Look, I found one gold coin, I told you there was gold here!&#34; said Pat.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Lucky gazed at his brother and then at the coin and said, &#34;If only you had always told the truth...I would have believed you sooner!&#34;</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Pat replied, &#34;You are right, I am sorry Lucky.&#34;</p><p></p>",

Amphibians live some of their lives in water and some of their lives on land. They are able to achieve this because their bodies go through amazing transformations, called metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">These neat creatures are cold&#8211;blooded. This means that they are the same temperature as their environment. The word amphibian technically means two&#8211;lives. A frog is one example of an amphibian.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Frogs begin their life cycle as an egg. They hatch into water as tadpoles which have gills and a small tail to help them swim. At this point, they are basically small fish. Soon, tadpoles begin to transform. They start to grow legs, and lungs begin to develop so they can breathe out of water.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">At 9 weeks old, the tadpole looks more like a frog than a tadpole. The whole metamorphosis is complete at 16 weeks. This is when the frog is an adult and lives out of the water.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Amphibians are very interesting and incredible creatures.</p><p></p>",
