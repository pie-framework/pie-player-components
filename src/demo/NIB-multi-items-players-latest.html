Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim envisioned a place on the internet where people could share their home movies with the world. They set up shop in a Silicon Valley garage, and Karim posted the first ever YouTube video in May of 2005. “Me at the Zoo” was just 19 seconds long, and it featured Karim casually speaking in front of the elephant enclosure. The video bore little semblance to the sophisticated productions often seen on YouTube today. In 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion. If the original YouTube founders had had a crystal ball, they might not have been so quick to sign on the dotted line!        </p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"no-number\"><img alt=\"\" id=\"e67737cdcd9f4cedb25be2bf76577660\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/8a8080818381b3740183ebf760bf31fe@0.0.177/image/jpeg/cf5abbd6-a42b-44a5-ba4a-65ff56b9b4a6\"></span></p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>It is difficult to overstate just how popular YouTube currently is. There are 2.1 billion monthly active users all over the world. Unlike TikTok, which has a mostly young user base, suggesting young people prefer entertainment over educational content, YouTube appeals to people of all ages. In fact, the majority of internet users in the U.S., whether they are 15 or over the age of 56, use YouTube. In some places outside of the U.S., the internet can, of course, be more difficult to access.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Think of video sharing platforms like candy stores. While some offer just a few flavors, YouTube has a treat to satisfy absolutely any taste or craving. Want to get help with a difficult math concept? You’ll likely have no trouble at all finding a tutorial. Looking for some entertainment? There are videos featuring pranks, fictional characters, and hilarious cats. Videos can be up to twelve hours long, while a YouTube short is, like most TikTok videos, less than a minute. The amount of content on YouTube is also constantly increasing. A 2020 estimate stated that 500 hours of content were being uploaded every single minute!</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Some young people who may have once said they wanted to be movie stars or professional sports players now aspire to be YouTubers. Those who can get enough views and subscribers on YouTube can indeed make money—serious money. In 2021, YouTuber Mr. Beast earned a staggering $54 million in gross revenue, making him the highest earning YouTube creator in history. It is hard not to feel a vague sense of injustice when there are so many doctors, nurses, firefighters, and police officers who will never come close to earning even a fraction of this amount. With that being said, the YouTube millionaire Mr. Beast is admittedly an inspiration to many. Stories like his show young people that with enough creativity, perseverance, and hard work, anyone with a camera and a YouTube account can make their dreams come true.    </p></div></div>",

In 2014, Musical.ly, a social media app, offered users the chance to share their lip-synching skills with the world. Over the next few years, the app racked up hundreds of millions of users. A rival app called Douyin, which was developed by the company ByteDance, appeared on the scene in 2016. Outside of China, Douyin was rebranded as TikTok, which is now a household name. In late 2017, ByteDance acquired Musical.ly, instantly—and substantially—increasing TikTok's user base.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>As of 2021, TikTok had more than one billion monthly active users in more than 150 countries, but it is undoubtedly a young person's app. TikTok videos can take many forms and be about practically any subject.

Unlike movies or episodes of a television series, most TikTok videos are mere seconds long. So, TikTok does not require users to invest a substantial amount of time. People with just a few minutes to spare before a sports practice or class can log in and escape with some lighthearted fun. The popularity of TikTok among young users suggests they would prefer to see many videos in a given amount of time instead of just one.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Interestingly, while TikTok is known for short videos, the maximum video length seems to keep going up. At first, a TikTok video could only be 15 seconds long, but this was later changed to 60 seconds. In 2022, the maximum length was increased to 10 minutes. This change could be an effort to appeal to a broader range of users, and it might reflect TikTok's desire to compete with YouTube more effectively.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Some people who spend a lot of time generating TikTok videos want to know: Can I make money doing this? The answer is yes! TikTok does have an ad revenue sharing program, but the payout is a drop in the bucket compared to what some TikTokers can make by becoming \"influencers.\" If TikTokers have a huge following, corporations will sometimes pay these influencers to feature and promote brands in their videos. And earnings can be mind-boggling. For example, TikTok personality Addison Rae earned an estimated $5 million in 2020. Success stories like these do have a downside, however. They can mislead people into thinking they, too, can make millions from TikTok, something only a miniscule percentage of people can do. If someone wants to make TikTok videos, the main goal should not be getting rich quick, but simply having fun.</p></div></div>",

Latin American Indians are the indigenous peoples who live in these areas. As of 2016, there were about 42 million Latin American Indians. More than half of Latin American Indians live in urban areas, but there are other groups that live in voluntary isolation. Latin American Indians can be a large or a small presence in a country. In 2021 in Mexico, for example, there were about 17 million indigenous people, or 15 percent of Mexico’s total population. In contrast, there were fewer than 100,000 indigenous people in Uruguay in 2021, or about 2.4 percent of that country’s population.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>While there is no doubt that Latin American Indians have a rich culture, it is impossible to present a succinct description. In Paraguay alone, indigenous peoples include the Toba, Qom, Maskoy, Manjuy, and Aché, just to name a few. There are hundreds more groups throughout Latin America. The indigenous peoples of Latin America speak more than 500 languages. Sadly, the culture of many groups is slowly disappearing over time.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The Quechua are just one indigenous group in Latin America with a rich culture. Making their homes in the Andean highlands, the Quechua use traditional flutes, called quenas and sikus, to create their signature huayno music. They use their spinning and weaving skills to create vibrantly-colored blankets and clothing. Foods important to the Quechua culture include potatoes, coca tea, and alpaca meat. This is just a cursory overview of a single group’s culture. Someone could likely spend years learning about Latin American Indian culture and still just scratch the surface.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Latin American Indians face a variety of challenges, but there are many outspoken and determined leaders who are willing to fight for important causes. One of them is Miriam Miranda, who began her life in a Garífuna village in Honduras. One of Miranda’s main interests is the protection of Garífuna land, and she has fought back against potentially destructive tourism and real estate projects. In her own words, Miranda explains, “The displacement of communities and the loss of cultures that come with the development of tourism is growing . . . but the Garífuna women, many of them elders, have incredible strength.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Whereas Miranda is a guardian of the land, Oscar Olivera is a defender of water. He successfully fought against the privatization of a Bolivian water source and is involved with efforts to combat water pollution.

              "text": "<h3>Shopping Malls:</h3><h4>An Important Part of Your Community</h4><div><div class=\"p-number\">1</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>At one time, countless people spent afternoons wandering through bustling shops in American malls and perhaps grabbing a bite at the food court before heading home with their purchases. The picture today is much different, and there are many \"ghost malls\" with echoing hallways and unsightly shuttered doors. According to one estimate, during the 1980s, there were about 2,500 malls in the United States. As of 2022, there were about 700. By 2032, that number could be as low as 150. There are numerous reasons why people should band together and ensure that does not happen.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>There are two main types of shoppers today: those who shop online from home and those who regularly venture out to the mall. One type of shopper chooses to spend even more time on screens, something most people already do far too much of in modern life, and their experience is impersonal and perhaps even isolating. The other type of shopper has the opportunity to meet up with friends or simply be in the company of other people while also getting exactly what they need.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Malls benefit the local economy. Picture a large piggy bank, and the coins inside represent all the money in a community's economy. People take money out when they earn a paycheck, and when they shop local, they put some of the money back in. On the other hand, people who shop online take money out without returning it. Over time, the piggy bank gets emptier and emptier, stores close, and jobs are lost.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"no-number\"><img alt=\"\" id=\"d93922c281844940a4447d331ff2cfe2\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/8a808081841c101e01842e6b0729069c@0.0.99/image/jpeg/84f19215-9d99-423f-993b-be1141f8e88a\"></span></p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Malls let shoppers get up close and personal with the products they want to buy. Everyone has heard those stories about online purchases—the beautiful dress that arrived with loose seams, the toy that was shockingly small. When people go to a store, they can inspect, feel, try on, and hold the products they are interested in, so what people see is truly what they get! Even better, people do not need to set up an account, provide personal information, and wait for delivery. Shopping in the mall offers instant gratification.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>As a final note, it is important to keep in mind that malls are more than just collections of retail spaces. They are an important part of many communities. Malls might host events to celebrate holidays, have special activities for kids, or even serve as venues for performances and concerts. Events may be affordable or even free, which can give more people the chance to create special memories.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>If we let malls continue to disappear from our landscape, some cherished traditions might become a thing of the past. And it probably will not be long before other community landmarks slowly begin to vanish, too.</p></div></div>",

Simon had some business to conduct in the next town, and he was not looking forward to the long trek in the blazing heat. He decided he would make the trip easier for himself by hiring a donkey to ride.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Simon went to his neighbor, who owned a donkey, and asked if he could hire it for his journey. The neighbor, who was always eager to make some money, was happy to oblige. He said that he would walk alongside the donkey during the trip to make sure Simon and the animal stayed safe. When Simon said he would feel bad making the neighbor walk all the way, the neighbor replied that was nonsense because he would get his money.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>So, off the two men went, Simon sitting atop the donkey and his neighbor walking apace to make sure that the donkey stayed the course. At first, the two men chatted pleasantly about the sights they saw along the way. However, as they passed the village outskirts, they entered a treeless plain that left them little to look at, but even worse, it left nothing to block the sun. For now, the sun had risen high in the sky, making the temperature intensely hot. The men continued on, but now each seemed lost in their own thoughts as they wiped the sweat from their brow and started to wilt in the sun.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Noticing his neighbor struggle, Simon suggested that they take a break and drink from the skins filled with water that they carried with them. His neighbor readily agreed, and Simon dismounted from the donkey while it was being held still. He sat down in the shade the animal offered. The neighbor went to join Simon in the shade, but, alas, the beast’s shadow was not large enough to accommodate both men.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"no-number\"><img alt=\"\" id=\"3b2dcd3c6e8f48a49746ad210f1dd714\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/8a8080818381acc00183ec0e9e723088@0.0.157/image/jpeg/b8f7a276-d298-4f96-b148-16983169ad1b\"></span></p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The neighbor asked Simon to move over a bit, but Simon refused, explaining that would place him in the sun. The neighbor responded that he had walked all the way and would have to walk again when they started up. He said that he deserved to rest in the shade. Now the argument began to get as hot as the day. Simon began shouting that he was the one who was paying, so it should be him that gets the shade.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>By this point, both men were standing, gesturing at each other angrily with their hands. They were so intent on their anger, that they didn’t even notice the donkey running away. At last, they paused their tirade, as each was fully exhausted from all their exertions in the sun. They both looked around and realized that it was just the two of them on the treeless plain, with neither donkey nor its shadow! Now, Simon would have to walk to the village and home in the sun, and the neighbor would have to search for his donkey and receive no money for his efforts.</p></div></div>",

We see what is perhaps sadness or terror in their eyes. Without knowing the whole story, we might assume that this is a frustrating end to the story of two young lovers. But the tale of Apollo and Daphne is really a story in which the two main characters cannot exercise free will.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"no-number\"><img alt=\"\" id=\"c2a8f381882440df97f6712d55b2b1d3\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/4028e4a233c6b7a50134063c4e0b3a92@0.0.940/image/jpeg/afe505fe-8182-4980-a188-7d44e5c4d40e\"></span></p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>In the tale of Apollo and Daphne, Apollo pursues his beloved Daphne, who turns into a laurel tree in order to escape from him. Apollo, it seems, just doesn’t know the meaning of “no,” and Daphne can never say “yes.” Why is this the case? Is Apollo just stubborn? Is Daphne simply arrogant? Although these reasons cannot be ruled out, there is another character whose role is very important early in the story.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>It turns out that Cupid not only has arrows that can make a person fall in love but also has arrows that can make a person shun love. He has gold arrows that cause love and lead arrows that repel it. Early in the story, Cupid uses both types of arrows. Daphne is struck with the lead arrow, and Apollo is struck with the gold arrow. So no matter how much Apollo tries to impress Daphne, she will never be able to love him. The reverse is also true; no matter how much Daphne rejects Apollo, he will not be able to stop loving her.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Why does a character like Cupid exist in the first place? His role seems to rob other characters of their abilities to choose their own destinies. There is a supposedly real story that may offer some explanation. Before the story of Apollo and Daphne was first told, a young prince fell in love with a maiden who did not return his affections. He pursued her, and she fled. When she reached a river, she fell in and drowned. When he realized what had happened, the prince comforted himself with the beauty of the laurel trees that grew beside the river. Perhaps those who are frustrated in love are better able to make peace with the situation if they believe it to be out of their control?</p></div></div>",

A party was planned upon his arrival.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame you can&#8217;t stay longer, General,&#8221; Laura Ratcliffe was saying. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard on us, living in conquered territory, under enemy rule.&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;I will not leave you entirely, Miss Ratcliffe,&#8221; Stuart told her. &#8220;I will be returning to my home in Culpepper in the morning. However, I will leave Captain Mosby and a few other men here to look after the loyal Confederate people like yourself. These men will stay until I can return after winning this war.&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     Captain Mosby was thirty years old but looked very youthful. He was below average height and extremely skinny. His hair and the beard he was wearing at the time were very light brown. He wore an officer&#8217;s uniform and instead of carrying a sword, he had a pair of guns on his belt.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     Tonight at the party, he looked quite refined. The cloak he was fastening was lined with scarlet silk and the gray cock-brimmed hat had a squirrel tail on it. Mosby looked like any other common Confederate soldier. However, deep in his blue eyes one could see that there was more to him than that. He was ruthless, self confident, good humored, and rude.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     For an instant he stood looking at the general. Then he realized what Stuart had said, and his blue eyes sparkled. This was the thing he had almost given up hoping for.

Tonight was another one of Father&#8217;s meetings. Recently it seemed as though Father had one of these meetings almost every other night. Father instructed Jackson to stay in his room during these meetings, but tonight Jackson&#8217;s curiosity got the best of him. He desperately wanted to know what the men were discussing.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     Through the slit in the door frame, Jackson could see the flickering of candlelight and shadows of three men in the room. At first he could not hear anything being said, but after a few minutes the men appeared to be arguing. This piqued Jackson&#8217;s interest even more. He curled his legs up to his chest and sat like a little ball in a dark corner. He listened carefully.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;This is very serious John. What should we do?

When Father looked up, the candlelight shone upon him. Jackson noticed the lines that seem to have grown on Father&#8217;s face, making him look much older than his actual age. Jackson had a knot in the pit of his stomach. His father had always been the kindest and most gentle person he had ever known. But recently Father seemed to have grown an outer shell. His constant talk of war and fighting alarmed Jackson. Father began speaking.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     &#8220;Okay, I understand. But, we need to be smart. We cannot afford any more bloodshed. Especially after the devastating outcome at Gettysburg.

Until then, I think we need to hold tight and wait.&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>     Suddenly the room seemed to go silent. Jackson looked through the crack and saw the three men huddled around pointing at something on Father&#8217;s antique wood desk. Jackson did not want to hear or see Father like this anymore. He retreated to his bed and, as he snuffed the wick of his bedside candle, he prayed the days ahead would get better and he would have his old father back.</p></div></div>",

              "text": "<h3>Black Beauty: My Early Home</h3><h5>by Anna Sewell</h5><div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\"><em>The book </em>Black Beauty<em> tells the story of a horse named Black Beauty. Beauty tells the story himself and talks about his life. In this part of the book, Beauty talks about when he was a young foal growing up on his mother&#39;s farm. He describes the nice meadow and pond where he would play with the other young horses. His mother Duchess teaches him good manners so he will grow up to be a kind and well-trained horse.</em></span></p></div><div class=\"p-number\">1</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master&#39;s house, which stood by the roadside; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>While I was young I lived upon my mother&#39;s milk, as I could not eat grass. In the daytime I ran by her side, and at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees, and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>As soon as I was old enough to eat grass my mother used to go out to work in the daytime, and come back in the evening. There were six young colts in the meadow besides me; they were older than I was; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play, for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>One day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother whinnied to me to come to her, and then she said: &#34;I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are cart-horse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born; your father has a great name in these parts, and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew, and I think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up gentle and good, and never learn bad ways; do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you trot, and never bite or kick even in play.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>I have never forgotten my mother&#39;s advice; I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her. Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Our master was a good, kind man. He gave us good food, good lodging, and kind words; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him, and my mother loved him very much. When she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy, and trot up to him.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\">Excerpt from <em>Black Beauty, </em>by Anna Sewell.

              "text": "<h3>The Pleasure of Writing</h3><h5>by A. A. Milne</h5><div><div class=\"p-number\">1</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Sometimes when the printer is waiting for an article which really should have been sent to him the day before, I sit at my desk and wonder if there is any possible subject in the whole world upon which I can possibly find anything to say. On one such occasion I left it to Fate, which decided, by means of a dictionary opened at random, that I should deliver myself of a few thoughts about goldfish&#8230; Today I am without a care. Nothing less has happened than that I have a new nib<sup>*</sup> in my pen.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>In the ordinary way, when Shakespeare writes a tragedy, or Mr. Blank gives you one of his charming little essays, a certain amount of thought goes on before pen is put to paper. One cannot write &#8220;Scene I. An Open Place. Thunder and Lightning. Enter Three Witches,&#8221; or &#8220;As I look up from my window, the nodding daffodils beckon to me to take the morning,&#8221; one cannot give of one&#8217;s best in this way on the spur of the moment. At least, others cannot. But when I have a new nib in my pen, then I can go straight from my breakfast to the blotting-paper, and a new sheet of foolscap fills itself magically with a stream of blue-black words. When poets . . . talk of the pleasure of writing, they mean the pleasure of giving a piece of their minds to the public; with an old nib a tedious business. They do not mean (as I do) the pleasure of the artist in seeing beautifully shaped &#8220;k&#8217;s&#8221; and sinuous &#8220;s&#8217;s&#8221; grow beneath his steel. Anybody else writing this article might wonder &#8220;Will my readers like it?&#8221; I only tell myself &#8220;How the compositors will love it!&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>But perhaps they will not love it. Maybe I am a little above their heads. I remember on one First of January receiving an anonymous postcard wishing me a happy New Year, and suggesting that I should give the compositors a happy New Year also by writing more generously. In those days I got a thousand words upon one sheet 8 in. by 5 in. I adopted the suggestion, but it was a wrench; as it would be for a painter of miniatures forced to spend the rest of his life painting the Town Council of Boffington in the manner of Herkomer. My canvases are bigger now, but they are still impressionistic. &#8220;Pretty, but what is it?&#8221; remains the obvious comment; one steps back a pace and saws the air with the hand; &#8220;You see it better from here, my love,&#8221; one says to one&#8217;s wife. But if there be one compositor not carried away by the mad rush of life, who in a leisurely hour (the luncheon one, for instance) looks at the beautiful words with the eye of an artist, not of a wage-earner, he, I think, will be satisfied; he will be as glad as I am of my new nib. Does it matter, then, what you who see only the printed word think of it?</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>A woman, who had studied what she called the science of calligraphy, once offered to tell my character from my handwriting. I prepared a special sample for her; it was full of sentences like &#8220;To be good is to be happy,&#8221; &#8220;Faith is the lode-star of life,&#8220; &#8220;We should always be kind to animals,&#8221; and so on. I wanted her to do her best. She gave the morning to it, and told me at lunch that I was &#8220;synthetic.&#8221; Probably you think that the compositor has failed me here and printed &#8220;synthetic&#8221; when I wrote &#8220;sympathetic.&#8221; In just this way I misunderstood my calligraphist at first, and I looked as sympathetic as I could. However, she repeated &#8220;synthetic,&#8221; so that there could be no mistake. I begged her to tell me more, for I had thought that every letter would reveal a secret, but all she would add was &#8220;and not analytic.&#8221; I went about for the rest of the day saying proudly to myself &#8220;I am synthetic! I am synthetic! I am synthetic!&#8220; and then I would add regretfully, &#8220;Alas, I am not analytic!&#8221; I had no idea what it meant.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>And how do you think she had deduced my syntheticness? Simply from the fact that, to save time, I join some of my words together. That isn&#8217;t being synthetic, it is being in a hurry. What she should have said was, &#8220;You are a busy man; your life is one constant whirl; and probably you are of excellent moral character and kind to animals.&#8221; Then one would feel that one did not write in vain.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>My pen is getting tired; it has lost its first fair youth. However, I can still go on. I was at school with a boy whose uncle made nibs. If you detect traces of erudition in this article, of which any decent man might be expected to be innocent, I owe it to that boy. He once told me how many nibs his uncle made in a year; luckily I have forgotten. Thousands, probably. Every term that boy came back with a hundred of them; one expected him to be very busy. After all, if you haven&#8217;t the brains or the inclination to work, it is something to have the nibs. These nibs, however, were put to better uses. There is a game you can play with them; you flick your nib against the other boy&#8217;s nib, and if a lucky shot puts the head of yours under his, then a sharp tap capsizes him, and you have a hundred and one in your collection. There is a good deal of strategy in the game (whose finer points I have now forgotten), and I have no doubt that they play it at the Admiralty in the off season. Another game was to put a clean nib in your pen, place it lightly against the cheek of a boy whose head was turned away from you, and then call him suddenly. As Kipling says, we are the only really humorous race. This boy&#8217;s uncle died a year or two later and left about &#163;80,000, but none of it to his nephew. Of course, he had had the nibs every term. One mustn&#8217;t forget that.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The nib I write this with is called the &#8220;Canadian Quill&#8221;; made, I suppose, from some steel goose which flourishes across the seas, and which Canadian housewives have to explain to their husbands every Michaelmas. Well, it has seen me to the end of what I wanted to say&#8212;if indeed I wanted to say anything. For it was enough for me this morning just to write; with spring coming in through the open windows and my good Canadian quill in my hand, I could have copied out a directory. That is the real pleasure of writing.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\"><sup>*</sup><em>nib</em>: the writing point of a pen, especially an insertable tapered metal part with a split tip</span></p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\">&#8220;The Pleasure of Writing&#8221; by A.

Mailboxes are located outside on the street. People can put their mail into a mailbox. A mail carrier collects all the mail in the mailbox at certain times of the day. In the United States, street mailboxes have been used since the 1850s.

The red mailboxes looked like fire boxes and equipment, which were also red. This confused firefighters when there was a fire.

He looked like he does now, except he had eight short, fat legs. Anansi was clever but a bit lazy.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>One day, Anansi was walking. Suddenly he smelled a delicious smell coming from Rabbit’s house.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Rabbit!” called Anansi. “What are you cooking?” Anansi peered into his friend’s kitchen window.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Greens, friend Anansi! Stay a while and help me do some chores, and when they are done we will eat together.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Unwilling to get stuck doing chores, Anansi said, “Friend Rabbit, I would love to eat some of your delicious greens. But right now, I have to run an errand.” Thinking quickly, Anansi spun a bit of web. “Here, Rabbit. I will leave one end of this web with you.” He tied the other end to his leg. “When the greens are done, just pull on the web, and I will come back.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Rabbit waved goodbye as Anansi went on his way. He had not gone more than a few yards when again he smelled something delicious cooking. He followed his nose until he came to the house of his friend Monkey.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Monkey!” he called out. “What is it you are cooking that smells so good?”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Beans, brother Anansi!” called Monkey. All of his little children came out to hug their friend. “Join us! We just need to wash some dishes and we can eat.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Anansi quickly offered to leave one end of his web with the monkeys. “I’ll tie the other end to my leg,” he said as he tied the web onto his second leg. “And when the beans are done, just pull on it and I will come back.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">10</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Well, as the story goes, Anansi continued walking, and six more times he smelled wonderful meals cooking in the kitchens of his friends. Soon he had webs dangling from all eight of his short legs.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">11</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>He sat down at the river to rest. Which wonderful meal would be ready first? Just then he felt a tug.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">12</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Ahh, Monkey’s beans! I can’t wait!” he said as he started to get up.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">13</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Then he felt another tug, and another, and another.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">14</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Soon, all eight of his legs were being tugged and pulled in eight different directions. His legs stretched and stretched until they were long and thin. Even today you can see that the spider has eight long, thin legs. He is always looking for food since he missed out on eight meals that day.<br><img alt=\"A spider is shown with each of its eight legs spread out in all directions and tied to web strands.\" id=\"e650c3b1f77b4ce0b811c50f8a4686d0\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/4028e4a23946dac501394fa5a3cc46c9@0.0.1256/image/jpeg/648a8e3f-3166-4597-a655-e410786aba0d\"></p></div></div>",

The pod was claustrophobic, cold, and lacked seating, and people preferred the couches and temperate atmosphere of the high-ceilinged community lounge for socializing. However, this was one of the few locations where Zarina and her friends could see the majestic views of outer space from an observation window.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Jennix, Nathn, and Draxx pointed at the craters and dark swirls of the rusty red planet before them, enchanted by the secrets they felt were contained within. But today, Zarina only listened while she held little Moonlet, the robotic puppy she had constructed. To her, the glowing sphere seemed a bit creepy, blazing in an infernal way, and not as enchanting as it usually did.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>They had been living on the Omega Hyperbius their whole lives, and as grandiose as it was, they all felt confined and constrained. But outside that window was boundless space, a whole galactic world waiting to be explored. Usually, Zarina was as excited as the rest about those mysteries, but today she felt like the ugly duckling, not part of the rest of the group. The others were animated about entering the Nova Program, which transitioned young people from school to work responsibilities, yet Zarina felt dread.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Jennix was hoping to become a pilot, traveling from planet to planetoid, exploring the remote reaches of the cosmos. Draxx’s dream was to get into the engineering program and work on the planetary colonies. Nathn had asked to be put in nutrition services to farm in one of the agricultural centers.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Zarina loved tinkering, so everyone said the robotics pathway was a natural for her, but what if it wasn’t? She clutched Moonlet as she felt the familiar pit of fear, as cold and hard as a comet. Suddenly, she blurted out, “I don’t want to leave you guys and go into the Nova Program!”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Jennix was the first to respond. “You know,” she said, “I don’t want to leave you all either, but we will always be friends.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“But what if I end up in the Garbage Sorting Center?” Zarina asked. She had an image of herself, trapped forever in the bowels of the station, performing the endless task of sorting mechanical bits and pieces, deciding what can be recycled.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Draxx pointed to Moonlet and said, “You’re such a mastermind at creation that you’re going to be valued from day one.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“And, even if you ended up in the Sorting Center,” Nathn continued, “you’d probably build a sorter robot with all the things that you found, and then you’d be able to just sit back and relax!”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">10</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>At that moment, a brilliant cosmic flash illuminated the outer pod. The kids ran to the window to witness the spectacle. As the bright light shone on Zarina, she recognized that her friends were right: She already had created robots, so with guidance, she would only improve. She smiled as she viewed the splendor before her.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"no-number\"><img alt=\"\" id=\"f0798447b8784c3097740a163fe50697\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/8a80808183fd4cea01840d10ca23026b@0.0.123/image/jpeg/99ecfc38-2786-45b4-b252-30fb17e2b14a\"></span></p></div></div>",

At first, he blamed the city campus; his Native tribe lived on the Timber Ridge reservation, miles from what he’d call civilization, without coffee shops and bistros and all of the hustle and bustle of a city campus. Naturally, moving from the reservation to the city would upend him a little, but his discontent reached beyond city life. Even his courses failed to inspire or interest him. Chogan routinely kept in touch with his uncle and his friends on the reservation, which helped to make him feel closer to his community, so when winter break finally arrived, he sprinted home, ready to hang out with the guys and do nothing for the next few weeks. “Maybe doing nothing will help me figure out what to do about school,” he thought.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>But his uncle had other plans for him.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“It’s just some furniture that needs to be moved from Charlie’s basement to a new apartment. We’ve got friends who need a place, fast, but for only a few months. They’ve got nothing, Chogan, absolutely nothing, so we’re doing this for them. Come on—and bring your muscles.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“I have plans, though—I’m going with Kele and Wynonah today. I haven’t seen them in months, so we’re going to play some hockey and then watch Kele’s brother work on his car . . . .” Chogan felt embarrassed by his own words. He didn’t want to disappoint his uncle, but everywhere Chogan and Uncle Lee went, people asked the same questions: How was school, what are you studying, what are you going to do after college . . . and Chogan could offer no answers for any of the questions. Hanging with Kele and Wynonah saved him from feeling cornered and admitting to himself that he still hadn’t decided on a path for his future. “Uncle, I just don’t know what to do with myself or what I want—”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Chogan, have you ever heard of the Seventh Generation? Our people are told a story of an Indian elder generations ago who feared for his people. In his lifetime, he saw his culture and the circle of his community slowly slipping away until one day, when he had a great vision. In it, he saw a future of famine and poverty, loss and grief, and more, a future stretching for seven long generations until the youth seven generations after him rose up and saved his Native nation. Seven generations in the future, the illnesses and darkness that plagued him and his tribe would end in light, and his culture would be strong again—the circle would come around once more.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Chogan stared almost despondently at his uncle, wondering whether his uncle honestly thought Chogan could be some kind of hero to seven generations of Native people. “Uncle, I don’t get it—I’m not Superman, and I can’t single-handedly save the reservation or your friends. I just want to hang with my own friends before I have to go back to school, so what does this have to do with me and the furniture you want me to move?”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“You say ‘I’ and ‘me’ in many of your sentences, Little Blackbird. The Seventh Generation is both about you and not about you. What you are able to do now, today, is a gift from seven generations past. It is because of the efforts that they made in their day that you can say ‘I’ and ‘me’ in yours, and in turn, the work you do today is the gift you give seven generations in the future.” Uncle Lee paused for a minute. “Do you understand what this means?”</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"no-number\"><img alt=\"\" id=\"40884559f8094c1d86de77d0bdcf6d3e\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/8a808081846984920184733bb8ce00ce@0.0.123/image/jpeg/9bfc29e6-86ec-44b2-b4b8-c42fbb7f7715\"></span></p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Later that morning, Chogan sat hunched over his knees on a bench by the frozen pond, slowly lacing up his skates in contemplative silence. He had considered his uncle’s words and the story of the Native elder, which had brought to mind not just his reservation community but his work at school, and after a minute of watching his friends play hockey, Chogan found himself reaching for his boots.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Uncle Lee tried to mask his surprise when Chogan burst into Charlie’s house with Kele, Wynonah, and four of his friends. “This Seventh Generation legend means that if we move the furniture today, we’re setting up a space not just for Uncle Lee and Charlie's friends, but a chance that he can someday provide a house for his children—which gives them a better chance at providing a home for their own children a generation after them. Without action today, those generations ahead don’t stand a chance, and without action today, the activism of our fathers and grandfathers—and uncles—goes to waste. We’re part of a chain, Uncle, and I won’t be the weak link. By the way, I’m changing my course in college to study Community Wellness so I can bring some Seventh-Generation strength to Timber Ridge, but for now, Kele and I are going to start with this sofa.”</p></div></div>",

              "text": "<h3>The EV</h3><h4>How Electric Vehicles Rode the Wave of the Future</h4><div><div class=\"p-number\">1</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Electric cars whir down highways everywhere today, their whispering engines and astonishing gas mileage impressing those old enough to remember the gas-guzzling, yacht-sized family station wagon of yore. Surprisingly, today’s slick, electric vehicles (or EVs) date back to the dawn of batteries in the mid-1800s: those motorized carriages foresaw the future, and that future is happening right now. Today’s electric vehicles continue to anticipate the future of technology and its impact on the environment.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Electric vehicles contain a battery-driven engine rather than the traditional, gasoline-fueled internal-combustion engine. In the mid-1800s, cell batteries were not rechargeable; they were powerful enough to move very early electric cars, but replacing single-use batteries every time the charge wore out made these early vehicles impractical. By 1900, however, the future arrived in the form of rechargeable batteries that stored enough fuel to move cars faster than their gasoline-powered peers and longer than old single-use batteries. Their battery-powered engines also held other advantages over gasoline cars: they lacked the terrible smell of pollutants and the noise of gas engines as well as the gas-engine’s hand crank necessary for starting the engine. But users of electric-charged vehicles in suburban and rural towns lacked access to one important detail at the turn of the 20th century: electricity. Gasoline was more readily available and affordable, and by the 1950s, the lure of the open road and faster speeds proved a death knell for the early EV movement.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The lithium-ion battery changed the way manufacturers and users thought of electric cars, mostly because the lighter, energy-dense battery increased drive time and made street-worthy EVs accessible to wealthy consumers. The increasing cost of fossil fuels in the later 20th century and an uptick in environmental laws made cleaner cars attractive to manufacturers as well as to buyers. And in 2000, the first hybrid cars—run on both electricity and gasoline—swept the market, ushering in the future that car makers had anticipated a century earlier. With the transition to plug-in electric cars now complete, the internal-combustion engine is quickly taking a back seat to EV technology.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>An electric engine depends on its battery for power, and the battery depends on electricity for its charge. When the battery charge is low, owners can plug a car into a standard 120-volt outlet, which can take quite a few hours to charge a thoroughly depleted battery; or, they can use a 240-volt outlet to get the job done faster. In recent years, the number of charging stations has grown exponentially in convenient spaces such as mall and school parking lots, in workspace garages, and in parking lots for public transportation. Some new EVs claim to drive 300 miles before needing a charge, but such a distance will depend on terrain and driving technique.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Electric cars have become enormously popular now that their price makes them accessible for a huge number of buyers; however, this popularity is causing some challenges for EV owners. For homeowners, creating a convenient charging port in a garage or driveway may be part of the commitment to buying an EV. A handy charging port makes it easy to have a fully charged vehicle ready for use. But for renters whose landlords do not offer a port, charging a car may depend on finding a public station or laying a power cord across a public sidewalk, which causes a hazard for pedestrians. While major cities around the world strive to increase the number and convenience of charging stations, finding ports in smaller communities remains slightly more difficult.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>In many ways, the future dreamed up by EV makers 30—or 100—years ago has arrived. Cars can now travel without fossil fuels, without emitting carbon pollution, using sustainable electric energy, and at prices many can afford. But the future of EVs includes yet more innovation, including motors placed directly in the wheels for better power efficiency and control. One maker claims its future models will reach 500 miles on a full battery charge. And ongoing research hopes to improve the environmental costs of battery production and disposal.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\"><img alt=\"\" id=\"228505f753124ca1b436a107bbedf7dc\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/8a808081846962800184731c6d7000bc@0.0.91/image/jpeg/0d9046ce-4109-4bae-baa6-be9bdcdfd6da\"></span></p></div></div>",

Nothing less has happened than that I have a new nib<sup>*</sup> in my pen.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>In the ordinary way, when Shakespeare writes a tragedy, or Mr. Blank gives you one of his charming little essays, a certain amount of thought goes on before pen is put to paper. One cannot write &#8220;Scene I. An Open Place. Thunder and Lightning. Enter Three Witches,&#8221; or &#8220;As I look up from my window, the nodding daffodils beckon to me to take the morning,&#8221; one cannot give of one&#8217;s best in this way on the spur of the moment. At least, others cannot. But when I have a new nib in my pen, then I can go straight from my breakfast to the blotting-paper, and a new sheet of foolscap fills itself magically with a stream of blue-black words. When poets . . . talk of the pleasure of writing, they mean the pleasure of giving a piece of their minds to the public; with an old nib a tedious business. They do not mean (as I do) the pleasure of the artist in seeing beautifully shaped &#8220;k&#8217;s&#8221; and sinuous &#8220;s&#8217;s&#8221; grow beneath his steel. Anybody else writing this article might wonder &#8220;Will my readers like it?&#8221; I only tell myself &#8220;How the compositors will love it!&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>But perhaps they will not love it. Maybe I am a little above their heads. I remember on one First of January receiving an anonymous postcard wishing me a happy New Year, and suggesting that I should give the compositors a happy New Year also by writing more generously. In those days I got a thousand words upon one sheet 8 in. by 5 in. I adopted the suggestion, but it was a wrench; as it would be for a painter of miniatures forced to spend the rest of his life painting the Town Council of Boffington in the manner of Herkomer. My canvases are bigger now, but they are still impressionistic. &#8220;Pretty, but what is it?&#8221; remains the obvious comment; one steps back a pace and saws the air with the hand; &#8220;You see it better from here, my love,&#8221; one says to one&#8217;s wife. But if there be one compositor not carried away by the mad rush of life, who in a leisurely hour (the luncheon one, for instance) looks at the beautiful words with the eye of an artist, not of a wage-earner, he, I think, will be satisfied; he will be as glad as I am of my new nib. Does it matter, then, what you who see only the printed word think of it?</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>A woman, who had studied what she called the science of calligraphy, once offered to tell my character from my handwriting. I prepared a special sample for her; it was full of sentences like &#8220;To be good is to be happy,&#8221; &#8220;Faith is the lode-star of life,&#8220; &#8220;We should always be kind to animals,&#8221; and so on. I wanted her to do her best. She gave the morning to it, and told me at lunch that I was &#8220;synthetic.&#8221; Probably you think that the compositor has failed me here and printed &#8220;synthetic&#8221; when I wrote &#8220;sympathetic.&#8221; In just this way I misunderstood my calligraphist at first, and I looked as sympathetic as I could. However, she repeated &#8220;synthetic,&#8221; so that there could be no mistake. I begged her to tell me more, for I had thought that every letter would reveal a secret, but all she would add was &#8220;and not analytic.&#8221; I went about for the rest of the day saying proudly to myself &#8220;I am synthetic! I am synthetic! I am synthetic!&#8220; and then I would add regretfully, &#8220;Alas, I am not analytic!&#8221; I had no idea what it meant.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>And how do you think she had deduced my syntheticness? Simply from the fact that, to save time, I join some of my words together. That isn&#8217;t being synthetic, it is being in a hurry. What she should have said was, &#8220;You are a busy man; your life is one constant whirl; and probably you are of excellent moral character and kind to animals.&#8221; Then one would feel that one did not write in vain.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>My pen is getting tired; it has lost its first fair youth. However, I can still go on. I was at school with a boy whose uncle made nibs. If you detect traces of erudition in this article, of which any decent man might be expected to be innocent, I owe it to that boy. He once told me how many nibs his uncle made in a year; luckily I have forgotten. Thousands, probably. Every term that boy came back with a hundred of them; one expected him to be very busy. After all, if you haven&#8217;t the brains or the inclination to work, it is something to have the nibs. These nibs, however, were put to better uses. There is a game you can play with them; you flick your nib against the other boy&#8217;s nib, and if a lucky shot puts the head of yours under his, then a sharp tap capsizes him, and you have a hundred and one in your collection. There is a good deal of strategy in the game (whose finer points I have now forgotten), and I have no doubt that they play it at the Admiralty in the off season. Another game was to put a clean nib in your pen, place it lightly against the cheek of a boy whose head was turned away from you, and then call him suddenly. As Kipling says, we are the only really humorous race. This boy&#8217;s uncle died a year or two later and left about &#163;80,000, but none of it to his nephew. Of course, he had had the nibs every term. One mustn&#8217;t forget that.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The nib I write this with is called the &#8220;Canadian Quill&#8221;; made, I suppose, from some steel goose which flourishes across the seas, and which Canadian housewives have to explain to their husbands every Michaelmas. Well, it has seen me to the end of what I wanted to say&#8212;if indeed I wanted to say anything. For it was enough for me this morning just to write; with spring coming in through the open windows and my good Canadian quill in my hand, I could have copied out a directory. That is the real pleasure of writing.</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\"><sup>*</sup><em>nib</em>: the writing point of a pen, especially an insertable tapered metal part with a split tip</span></p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p><span class=\"no-number\">&#8220;The Pleasure of Writing&#8221; by A.

Reid was the smartest kid Matt knew, to be sure, but an invisibility suit? Even though it <em>was </em>the year 2056 and invisibility technology had been a dream of scientists for decades, Matt never imagined he&#8217;d see the real thing in his lifetime, let alone see it invented by a twelve-year-old boy genius who just happened to be his best friend.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;Ta-da!&#8221; said Reid. He was fully visible, and he looked ridiculous. Matt responded by laughing hysterically.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;I hate to tell you this, but if anything, you look incredibly <em>visible</em>. If you walked into a room full of people, you would be the most noticeable person there!&#8221; Matt couldn&#8217;t stop laughing.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Reid had anticipated this reaction and waited patiently for Matt to finish his mocking critique before very dramatically pulling a pair of safety goggles from his backpack and instructing Matt to put them on. Matt took the glasses, put them on his face, and looked at Reid&#8212;but Reid seemed to have completely disappeared.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;How did you . . . what is . . . I can&#8217;t believe . . .&#8221; Matt sputtered to make sense.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Reid smiled and reached over to remove the safety goggles from his friend&#8217;s face. Matt shook his head as Reid suddenly re-appeared and began speaking. &#8220;I began doing research last year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I learned that scientists are creating lenses that can bend light and make an object covered in material such as this,&#8221; he gestured to the shiny material of the suit he was wearing, &#8220;appear to be invisible. This technology will make it so that surgeons can see past their hands, truck drivers will be able to see past obstacles in front of their trucks and be safer on the roads. This technology is going to be incredibly beneficial!&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Matt was impressed. Reid went on. &#8220;OK, so, as you know, everyone in my family wears glasses. I created a lens from extremely thin film and have secretly placed it in each of their frames. When I walk around my house in this reflection suit this afternoon, no one will know I&#8217;m there!&#8221; Reid looked triumphant.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Matt&#8217;s expression clouded. &#8220;Hmmm . . . but how will that be &#8220;beneficial&#8221; like the stuff scientists are developing for surgeons and truck drivers? What you&#8217;re talking about just sounds like, well, spying. It doesn&#8217;t sound like you, Reid.&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;You say that now,&#8221; said Reid, &#8220;but when you hear about all I am able to accomplish while invisible, you will beg me to make a suit for you.&#8221; Matt shrugged reluctantly at his friend, wondering if Reid understood what he was getting himself into.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">10</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Later that day, Reid was pleased to see that his parents and both sisters were home. Alone in his room, he unpacked his suit and put it on. He walked quickly into his sisters&#8217; bedroom and stood by the window. When the girls walked in, they were chatting excitedly and looking at a list his sister Meg had in her hand.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">11</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;OK, so all of the kids we invited to Reid&#8217;s surprise party have said they can come,&#8221; said Meg, checking off items on the list. &#8220;That&#8217;s great!&#8221; replied his younger sister Cora.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">12</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;Grandma and Grandpa are going to be able to drive in from Chicago, too! Reid is going to be SO surprised!&#8221; Reid put both hands up to his invisible face, feeling the shock of learning information he was not supposed to hear.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">13</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>He snuck out of the room as quickly and quietly as he could, but as he stepped out into the hall, he overheard his parents having their own secret conversation by the stairs. Reid&#8217;s dad was telling Reid&#8217;s mom that he had found the perfect birthday gift for Reid that morning, and Reid&#8217;s mom listened excitedly before revealing another surprise for the party.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">14</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Reid ran as fast as he could to his bedroom and quickly removed the suit. He pulled up his communicator and typed a text message to Matt: &#8220;You were right about everything. Am retiring the suit. Will explain everything at school tomorrow.&#8221;</p></div></div>",

I hear Sheridan will march troops down from Cumberland, and you know what they&#8217;re going to do, right? His Union Army will burn everything in the valley and leave nothing behind for us&#8212;nothing to eat and nowhere to live.&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>From his vantage point, frozen in front of the open barn door, Dean heard the man&#8217;s voice grow agitated as he spoke. Without thinking, Dean jumped to the left and plastered his back against the side of the barn, palms pressed against the warm wood, his eyes watching the open door.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to stay at my father&#8217;s farm,&#8221; a woman&#8217;s voice urged, &#8220;but he&#8217;s so far north, Andrew, and we don&#8217;t know whether the cart will travel that far.&#8221; Their voices became muffled just before Dean heard footsteps heading towards the barn door. A moment later, a woman entered the blinding Virginia sunlight, her back to Dean as she walked away. He watched her long skirt brush the dusty ground, saw the wooden bucket swing in her hand, and breathed a sigh of relief as she disappeared from view.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;Okay, so, this is a little weird,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;just a little bit wrong.&#8221; He dug his cell phone out of his school bag, reaching past car keys that rattled conspicuously and absurdly outside the old barn. &#8220;No signal, of course, you worthless android,&#8221; he muttered, unceremoniously shoving the phone into his jeans pocket just as Andrew stepped around the corner and faced him, a heavy iron bar at the ready in his strong, clenched fist.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;Hello, stranger,&#8221; Andrew said cautiously, his eyes assessing Dean with both curiosity and concern. &#8220;Is there something I can help you with?&#8221;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Only a minute earlier, Dean had been halfheartedly listening to his study group debate details of the Civil War battles that had taken place 160 years ago in his home town, right outside the school cafeteria in which they all sat that very moment. He had desperately wanted to leave, but his friends seemed bent on reviewing every detail of the war in real time, minute by minute. He didn&#8217;t care about farms and battles and North and South. Dean watched the wind tirelessly swirl the leaves and rubbish in the parking lot outside of the cafeteria doors and knew it was time to cut out, so he slid his laptop into his messenger bag in a split second and slipped through the doors before anyone knew he&#8217;d gone.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The heavy glass and metal door rattled shut behind him as he stepped onto grass&#8212;not parking lot&#8212;and, impossibly, saw fields stretching to the ridgeline that had been hidden for years behind the strip mall. But the decrepit Shockeysville Mall he knew so well was gone, as were the buildings and streets around it. Instead, a rambling fieldstone wall and split-rail fence stretched across lush acreage; he saw trees and cows in the distance and, like a shot, he turned to reenter the cafeteria door, convinced that what he was seeing was the product of an overactive imagination and a lack of sugary snacks. He reached up to where he knew the metal door handle should be, only there was no handle. In fact, there was no cafeteria door because the cafeteria was gone, replaced by a wooden barn and an open door swung far aside and offering him a view of the shady, mote-filled interior, and&#8212;now&#8212;of Andrew.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Before Dean could mutter a response, both Andrew and Dean heard a terrifying sound from beyond the ridgeline: gunshots, three loud and powerful reports from an ordnance rifle, echoing off the trees surrounding the farm. The men glanced in the direction of the sound, and when Andrew looked back, his immediate concern for Dean had evaporated.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a Union sympathizer, then I think your friends are heading this way. But if you&#8217;re not,&#8221; he spat, &#8220;then you&#8217;re about to have a very bad day.&#8221; Andrew spun on his heel and hurried off in the direction the woman had gone, leaving Dean shaking his head and still plastered against the barn.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">10</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#8220;What is HAPPENING here? Where is the school, why are Union troops marching in, and what&#8217;s with her dress?&#8221; He paced in confusion, glancing in the direction of the three shots. &#8220;I know I&#8217;m home, because I can see the ridgeline, but this is NOT home. I walked through the cafeteria door,&#8221; he thought, mentally retracing his steps. He looked into the barn, its soaring cathedral ceiling a rib cage of massive beams and its wide-planked floor strewn with bits of hay and earth. Simple tools hung from the wall&#8212;a rake, a harness, a length of rope, an axe. Andrew had built a house with those tools, and Rachel had made it a home. And Sheridan&#8217;s troops would destroy their life&#8217;s work in minutes.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">11</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>With a gut-wrenching lurch, Dean slowly realized not where, but when he was. &#8220;Andrew said Sheridan is marching, which means it&#8217;s August of 1864, and the Union army is heading for Shockeysville. It doesn&#8217;t matter whose side Andrew is on, because his house is below the Mason-Dixon line, and Sheridan will never leave it in one piece for the Confederate Army to use. I need to help Andrew&#8212;or find a portal home, FAST.&#8221;</p></div></div>",

              "text": "<h3>Breaking News</h3><div><div class=\"p-number\">1</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>On Tuesday, Shonda hustled into the newsroom just in time to hear her new boss, the managing editor of the <em>Billford Citizen, </em>call her name.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Shonda, great—welcome aboard! Now, there’s a graffiti artist in town who’s been hired to paint a mural on the exterior of the post office building, and I want you to go find out who it is, get everything you can about them and the mural, and give me a pitch for the story by noon tomorrow, okay? And on Friday night, sit in on the town meeting at 7:30. They’re voting on whether to repurpose the old rail depot into a performing arts center, and we think there’s going to be a massive turnout. Get the numbers—you know: who attended, what the final vote is, whether anyone threw a tantrum because of the final decision—and build a balanced article, Shonda, without opinion or taking sides.” Shonda frenetically jotted notes into her phone as she wondered whether her mom would let her borrow the car on Friday.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Sure. Okay, Mr. Meredith.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Every day at the <em>Billford Citizen </em>began in the same way: Shonda would arrive after school, and Mr. Meredith would pile up assignments that were due by impossible deadlines. Within a week, he’d also given Shonda a set of newsroom keys so she could come in early on days her column was due. Then he asked her to copyedit the entire calendar section and to update the print resources room. Nothing was too much for Shonda, who performed each task to perfection and hit every deadline. After all, a part-time job with the local newspaper was a fantastic résumé piece that demonstrated to colleges just how dedicated she was to a career in journalism. She was sure she’d be named her class valedictorian, too, and the free school lunch program had exceeded its own expectations due to her tireless leadership.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>One morning, about three weeks after Shonda started working at the<em> Citizen, </em>her brother Tyler lounged at the kitchen table as Shonda trundled in for breakfast wearing mismatched pajamas and shuffled over to the coffee pot, her braids shrouding puffy eyes that made her look far from the tireless leader everyone thought she was. She caught him staring at her in disbelief, brows raised, coffee cup halfway to his mouth. “Tell me again,” he said, “how much you need this job, because local art is a thrill-a-minute—I mean, you’re reporting on whether an artist used Titian Red or just plain-old red, or whether they dished out the money for real sable brushes or bought synthetic, right? Surely there’s a Pulitzer in there somewhere. Honestly, Shonda, if you want to be an investigative reporter, why are you breaking yourself over small-town stuff?”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Small-town stuff is important, Tyler, because it’s the world we interact with every day, and because what happens here affects what happens in the rest of the world. The <em>Citizen </em>is a great local paper, and Mr. Meredith only wants the best for it.” But Shonda had started to wonder whether she was the best person for the <em>Citizen</em>.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>A week later, Tyler drove Shonda to the newsroom, the silence hanging heavily in the car. She knew she had to talk to Mr. Meredith about how she was letting him down, about how she wasn’t the dependable staff member he thought she was, so she trudged reluctantly toward the door to his office with every confidence that she was about to be fired from her first real job.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Mr. Meredith, I have tomorrow’s deadline . . . my article is due. I have the fundraising gala to plan, and then there’s photo archives to digitize and organize. I almost forgot about an interview I scheduled with a pottery club, and I submitted an article to the copyeditor without even proofreading it first—I misspelled <em>orange</em>, Mr. Meredith! <em>Orange</em>! I don’t think I’m the right person for this job.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>“Shonda, listen, I’ve been thinking about your contributions here at the <em>Billford Citizen,</em> and they’re spectacular, really spectacular. My problem is that I want the <em>Citizen</em> to be the best local paper it can be, but it can’t be great if I ask too much of my staff. I don’t see how anyone could be responsible for the kind of stellar work you do here and keep up with school at the same time if I place unreasonable expectations on them. You’re the best person for the job that you signed up for—a part-time job, two days each week—so let’s help you be the best reporter you can be for this paper that we love. Let’s look at the work you have in front of you and reduce it to a manageable list that you can complete in those two days. You can’t be any good for this paper, Shonda, or for anyone if you’re overwhelmed with responsibilities. Of course,” he said with a wink, “it means I’ll have to take you off the Arts desk, which I’m sure you’ll find disappointing.”</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">10</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>He opened a desk drawer with a clatter and handed Shonda a <em>Billford Citizen</em> identification tag on a long, blue lanyard. Beneath her name were the words “Investigative Reporter, City Desk.”</p></div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"no-number\"><img alt=\"\" id=\"d0f00ebea7f54d45ad3244f98fc1f626\" src=\"https://assets.pie-api.com/assets/8a808081841c045001844ecf48366f93@0.0.107/image/jpeg/190f737e-18cb-4a42-82f3-50f964032c8f\"></span></p></div></div>",

              "text": "<h1>Epilogue from The Secret of the Yellow Death: A True Story of Medical Sleuthing </h1><h2>by Suzanne Jurmain</h2><p>[1] After December 31, 1900, the battle against yellow fever continued.&nbsp;</p><p>[2] As soon as the results of the Reed team’s work were known, public health officials <u>launched </u>an all-out <u>campaign </u>against the mosquitoes that carried the disease. In the United States and Cuba a <u>virtual </u>army of sanitation workers used poison <u>fumes </u>to kill mosquitoes that lurked in buildings and wiped out eggs by spraying oil on the pools, ponds, puddles, and containers of still water where the insects liked to breed. Killing the mosquitoes killed the yellow fever germs the insects carried, and by the end of 1901 there were no cases of the illness in Havana, Cuba. By 1905 the United States was free of the disease. And between 1902 and 1914—thanks to an <u>effective </u>battle against germ-bearing mosquitoes in Central America—U.S. workers were able to safely build the Panama Canal.&nbsp;</p><p>[3] As the threat of yellow fever gradually <u>receded</u>, people <u>showered </u>Dr. Finlay and the Reed team scientists with honors, thanks, and praise. Statues of Carlos Finlay were set up in Cuba. A medical <u>society </u>and an American elementary school were named after him; and—though he never won—Dr. Finlay was <u>nominated </u>for one of science’s greatest awards, the Nobel Prize in medicine, three times before his death in 1915.&nbsp;</p><p>[4] Although Walter Reed died of <u>appendicitis </u>in 1902, soon after his return from Cuba, he, too, became a hero. Researchers <u>adopted </u>Reed’s belief that all volunteers in scientific experiments should be <u>fully informed</u> of all the risks. In 1909 the American government named the Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C., after the team’s chief investigator. And in 1929, Congress awarded all the American volunteer scientists (including Dr. Jesse Lazear) one of the nation’s highest honors, the Congressional Gold Medal, for their work on yellow fever.&nbsp;</p><p>[5] But while people and governments were honoring past work on the illness, twentieth-century scientists were looking for new ways to fight the terrible disease. Until his death in 1907, Dr. James Carroll continued to search for the yellow fever germ. Although his efforts were unsuccessful, Carroll <u>ultimately </u>came to believe that the disease is caused by a microbe that is much smaller than bacteria. Dr. Aristides Agramonte, who taught bacteriology in both the United States and Cuba before his death in 1931, tended to agree. And by 1927 scientists knew that the disease was produced by a virus—an extremely tiny, extremely simple <u>microorganism </u>that is so much smaller than bacteria, it cannot be seen with an ordinary microscope.&nbsp;</p><p>[6] Once scientists had identified the virus, the next step was to make a vaccine that would prevent people from getting the disease. That, however, proved difficult. Although researchers worked on the problem, progress was slow until scientists discovered two facts that the Reed team had not known. In the late 1920s and early 1930s researchers learned that some types of monkeys could actually get yellow fever and that, under special conditions, the virus could sometimes be grown inside the bodies of ordinary white laboratory mice. Using animals made experimental work much easier; and, finally, in 1936, Dr. Max Theiler developed a vaccine that safely kept humans from getting the disease.&nbsp;</p><p>[7] Research also continued on other <u>fronts</u>; and, during the twentieth century, scientists answered many of the questions about the cause and spread of yellow fever that had puzzled earlier investigators. Researchers learned that an infected female mosquito can pass the virus on to all her offspring through her eggs. They found that the yellow fever virus actually enters every cell of an infected mosquito’s body. And they discovered that a female mosquito transmits the disease by dripping infected <u>saliva </u>into the wound while she is sucking blood.&nbsp;</p><p>[8] Additional investigation uncovered more facts, and scientists soon realized that a mosquito must bite a yellow fever patient in the first three days of the illness in order to pick up the infection. They also learned that the virus may have to remain in the insect’s body for as much as seventeen days before the bug can infect a person with the disease. To scientists, this information was particularly interesting because it explained why some of the Reed team’s volunteers did not come down with yellow fever after being bitten. In some cases, it was clear that the team’s mosquitoes weren’t carrying the germ because they hadn’t bitten yellow fever victims during the <u>crucial </u>three-day <u>infectious </u>period at the beginning of the illness. In other instances, volunteers did not get sick because the germ was not allowed to stay inside the <u>host </u>mosquito long enough.&nbsp;</p><p>[9] Today, researchers believe that the yellow fever virus <u>originated in</u> West Africa and was brought to the Americas by slave ships carrying infected insects. They also know that the germ still lurks in the <u>dense </u>jungles of Africa and South America, where it infects monkeys and is carried by mosquitoes who transmit it to endless <u>generations </u>of offspring through their eggs.&nbsp;</p><p>[10] Vaccination programs and mosquito <u>extermination </u>programs have slowed the spread of yellow fever, but it is impossible to completely eliminate the virus. Many poor countries cannot afford to pay for the lifesaving vaccine, and some people now believe that <u>insecticides </u>should not be used to kill mosquitoes because these poisons may damage the environment.</p><p>[11] At this moment there is still no cure for yellow fever, and deadly outbreaks of the disease can still occur. In the early 1960s, 30,000 people died during a yellow fever epidemic in Ethiopia. The illness continues to <u>plague </u>people in parts of Africa and South America. Only three companies—in France, Brazil, and Senegal—now <u>rank </u>as approved yellow fever vaccine producers and <u>demand </u>is sometimes high. When the government of Paraguay failed to provide enough vaccine during a 2008 outbreak of the fever, desperate people <u>mobbed </u>clinics, yelling, “Vaccinations! Vaccinations!”&nbsp;</p><p>[12] In the twenty-first century yellow fever is still one of the many diseases that <u>threaten </u>humans, and doctors are still trying to develop new ways to combat the illness. Some, but not all, <u>modern </u>research can be done with laboratory animals. For that reason, in countries around the world, many scientists and many ordinary people—like those who worked with Reed—are now knowingly risking possible illness, injury, or even death in order to voluntarily participate in experiments that test new vaccines, new treatments, new medical <u>techniques</u>, and new drugs that may one day benefit <u>humanity</u>.</p><p><u>____________________________</u></p><h2><strong>Glossary</strong> </h2><p><strong>adopted</strong>–took on </p><p><strong>appendicitis</strong>–disease of the appendix </p><p><strong>campaign</strong>–set of organized actions </p><p><strong>crucial</strong>–very important </p><p><strong>demand</strong>–need </p><p><strong>dense</strong>–thick </p><p><strong>effective</strong>–successful </p><p><strong>extermination</strong>–killing </p><p><strong>fronts</strong>–areas fully </p><p><strong>informed</strong>–made completely aware </p><p><strong>fumes</strong>–gasses </p><p><strong>generations</strong>–group of living things born in the same period </p><p><strong>host</strong>–living thing in which something else lives </p><p><strong>humanity</strong>–all humans </p><p><strong>infectious</strong>–contagious </p><p><strong>insecticides</strong>–insect poison </p><p><strong>launched</strong>–began </p><p><strong>microorganism</strong>–one-celled living thing </p><p><strong>mobbed</strong>–crowded around </p><p><strong>modern</strong>–of present or recent times </p><p><strong>nominated</strong>–suggested for a particular position or honor </p><p><strong>originated</strong> <strong>in</strong>–came from </p><p><strong>plague</strong>–harm </p><p><strong>rank</strong>–stand </p><p><strong>receded</strong>–shrunk </p><p><strong>saliva</strong>–spit </p><p><strong>showered</strong>–gave a lot to </p><p><strong>society</strong>–group</p><p><strong>techniques</strong>–ways of doing something </p><p><strong>threaten</strong>–put in danger </p><p><strong>ultimately</strong>–in the end </p><p><strong>virtual</strong>–almost</p>",

At the end of the task, you will be asked to write an analytical essay comparing the points of view in the texts.</strong></p><p>Read the passage from “Understanding Insects as Friends or Foes.” Then answer the questions.</p><p>from “Understanding Insects as Friends or Foes”</p><p><em>by </em>Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development</p><ol><li><p>Insects can be found nearly everywhere. Some insects are helpful to people. Other insects are harmful and cause damage to trees and crops. Farmers and gardeners need to know which insects are friends and which are not. Insects can carry diseases, damage crops, make fruits and vegetables look bad and can even destroy entire crops, which limits the amount of food available for people and animals to eat. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a pest management system that focuses on managing pests with the least possible impact on people, property, and the environment. Farmers use tools like crop rotation, sprays or good bugs to help their crops. Using traps, scouting and identifying insects, and controlling bugs are all important tools for farmers to use.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Farmers/Growers use:</strong></p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Chemical crop sprays or powders</strong>—farmers use as little as needed, to protect the environment and to protect the water and food supplies. Pesticide applications are a useful tool, when applied according to label instructions by registered and certified pesticide applicators.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Crop Rotation</strong>—farmers do not grow the same crop every year, but instead rotate which crops they plant in each field. For instance, one year a farmer may grow a field of corn. The next year, the farmer may grow alfalfa hay in that field. Farmers do this because certain bugs like certain crops. By growing different crops year after year, bugs will leave. Crop rotation is a common practice on sloping soils because of its potential for saving soil. Rotation also reduces fertilizer needs, because alfalfa and other legumes replace some of the nitrogen corn and other grain crops remove. With crop rotation, pesticide costs may be reduced by naturally breaking the cycles of weeds, insects and diseases. As added benefits, grass and legumes in a rotation protect water quality by preventing excess nutrients or chemicals from entering water supplies; meadow or small grains cut soil erosion dramatically; and crop rotations add diversity to a farming operation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Good Insects</strong>—farmers also use “good” or beneficial insects to protect their crops and get rid of harmful insects. Some insects can do a lot of damage to crops and orchards. An insect’s worst enemies are other insects. Of the millions of insects that eat animals instead of plants, most feed on other insects. Using insects to control insects is called a “biocontrol” method. Biological control is the use of naturally occurring organisms that act as natural enemies to the pests in question. These approaches to pest management may be used to reduce pesticide use. The introduction and encouragement of natural predators is a highly effective method of controlling many bugs. Some quick biocontrol definitions: Pest—an unwanted insect or weed; Pathogen—bacterium or fungus that causes disease in a pest; Parasite—an insect that feeds in a living pest; and Predator—an insect that eats pests. When used effectively, biocontrol methods can be a safe and effective approach to pest management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scouting/Trapping</strong>—farmers must watch their fields or orchards closely. Farmers look on the leaves of the trees or plants for bugs. This is called scouting. To help find the insects, farmers use traps. When pests are found that could damage the crop, the farmer must choose the best way to get rid of the pest. Traps are hung in fruit trees, in greenhouses and on posts in fields for other crops. A scent, called a pheromone, is used inside the trap. This attracts the bugs to the trap. The trap is sticky inside, so when the bugs fly into the trap to smell the pheromone they get stuck. Killing adult bugs stops the cycle of egg laying or larval development and reduces pest populations. Sometimes farmers need help identifying the insects they find. They use a key, or guide. A key uses color, the number of legs or other things to determine what bug they have found.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"6\"><li><p>In addition to the pest management tools listed above, keeping things clean goes a long way toward reducing pest problems, especially indoor pests like cockroaches, ants and houseflies. Cleanliness is also important on farms for pest control, especially around feed piles and manure-prone areas.</p></li><li><p>The most important thing you can do to control bugs is to learn as much as you can about the life cycles and preventative treatments for bugs that are bugging you.</p></li></ol><p>Printed with permission of Michigan Farm Bureau.</p>",

A rainbow of flowers is a great way to add color to your yard. I have been adding to my garden for 16 years and have learned a lot about how to make it look terrific. You too can have a beautiful garden!</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>       Planting flower bulbs is an easy way to fill your garden with flowers. Flower bulbs are small, rounded plants that are resting before they start growing. They can be planted in the ground and will grow into flowering plants. I find that bulbs take very little work to plant. Just dig a hole, drop in your bulb, and cover with soil! Each type of bulb is a little different, but those are the basic steps.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>      It is best to make a plan before you start planting. Planning out your garden takes a little work. The work will pay off, though! Think about what time of year you want your flowers to bloom. Do you want them to look their best in the spring or summer? Make sure to plant your bulbs at the right time. Some bulbs need to be planted in the fall. Those are bulbs that need the cold temperatures of winter in order to grow. Other bulbs cannot stand the winter. Those bulbs should be planted in the spring.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>      The first year I grew a garden, I planted only short, purple flowers. How boring! Now I know, though, to plant flowers together that look different. In my opinion, a mix of a few colors in the same spot looks best. Also, plant tall flowers with shorter flowers. This will make your garden look more interesting. Another tip for getting your garden to stand out is to plant flowers in groups. That will look more natural than single flowers in a row.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>        If you follow some of my tips, you will be on your way to beautiful blooms!</p></div></div>",

He carried the heavy box down the hallway to the kitchen where he found his mother, father, and sister unpacking various gadgets. Samuel&#39;s family had sold their previous home and moved into this old Victorian-style house so his father could work at the local hospital. Samuel didn&#39;t relish the idea of moving at first, but now he thought this might not be such a bad place to call home. Additionally, school didn&#39;t start for another month, so Samuel and his sister, Catherine, would have time to explore their new neighborhood and meet other kids.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>After Samuel placed the cardboard box on the kitchen counter, his mother rushed over and started inspecting it.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;This box contains your great-grandmother&#39;s wedding china,&#34; Mom explained as she opened it. &#34;These dishes are very old and fragile, so I hope they survived the move.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>While his mother carefully examined each piece of china, Samuel asked his father what needed to be accomplished next.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;Well, you and Catherine can take the boxes of winter clothes up to the attic after lunch,&#34; Dad said as he put spices and canned goods away in the pantry. &#34;We&#39;ll also need to see if the previous owners left anything behind and clear it out.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Catherine let out a groan at the thought of spending the afternoon cleaning the attic.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;Come on, Catherine,&#34; Samuel said with a smile. &#34;Clearing out the attic might be fun! You never know what treasures might be hidden in this old house.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">8</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Catherine replied, &#34;You&#39;ve got your head in the clouds if you think we&#39;ll discover hidden treasures in this place. I think we&#39;re more likely to find a bunch of clutter.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">9</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>After lunch, Samuel and Catherine hauled several boxes to one of the guest rooms, where they could access the stairs to the attic. The attic was hot, and Catherine immediately felt like leaving the cramped space. They deposited the boxes in one corner of the large attic and then looked around to see what had been left behind.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">10</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Catherine let out a dramatic sigh when she reached the opposite end of the attic where several cardboard boxes were piled against the wall. Unfortunately, they would need to go through them all to see what was inside.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">11</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Samuel found a box of old books that were in good condition and could be taken to the local library. Catherine&#39;s mood improved immensely after finding a trunk filled with outdated clothes. Samuel could not keep a straight face when he saw her donning a hideous floral scarf and an enormous feathered hat. The clothes were spotless, so Catherine decided to donate them to the high school&#39;s drama department.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">12</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>After spending most of the afternoon sorting through boxes, Samuel had just about run out of steam when he heard Catherine let out a gasp of excitement.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">13</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;Samuel, take a look at this!&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">14</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>His sister was pointing at something, and Samuel peered over her shoulder to see a wooden box sitting on one of the rafters near the ceiling.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">15</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>He carefully dislodged the box from its resting place and set it on the attic floor. Samuel noticed that the locked box had the name &#34;Reynolds&#34; painted on one side and assumed this was the name of a family that once lived in the house.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">16</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;Let&#39;s try to open it and see if there really is treasure inside!&#34; Samuel exclaimed as he searched the rafter for the key that would unlock the mysteries inside the box.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">17</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;No, Samuel,&#34; Catherine said quickly. &#34;Imagine that this box contained Great&#8211;grandmother&#39;s wedding china or Dad&#39;s baseball card collection. You wouldn&#39;t want someone to look through it, would you?&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">18</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>After listening to Catherine, Samuel had a change of heart and abandoned his search for the missing key. When they finished their task, the siblings brought the wooden box downstairs to show their parents.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">19</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Samuel&#39;s mother immediately recognized the name on the box. &#34;This is the name of the woman who sold us this house,&#34; she explained. &#34;She inherited the home from her grandfather, but she didn&#39;t think that she could handle all the maintenance. Ms. Reynolds only lives a few blocks away, so we could return the box to her this evening.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">20</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>About half an hour later, Samuel, Catherine, and their mother stood on the steps of a small brick house. A woman with bright red hair answered the door and smiled after recognizing the children&#39;s mother. Their mother introduced Samuel and Catherine, and Ms. Reynolds ushered them all inside. Samuel held onto the box as everyone took seats around a small kitchen table. He carefully placed the box on the table and told Ms. Reynolds about their discovery. After listening, Ms. Reynolds abruptly left the kitchen. She returned a few moments later with an antique key in her hand. Samuel felt his heart begin to race as he waited for Ms. Reynolds to open the box and reveal what was inside.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">21</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Ms. Reynolds&#39;s face filled with emotion when she finally opened the lid.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">22</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>&#34;It&#39;s filled with old photographs and letters from my grandparents,&#34; Ms. Reynolds said in a quiet voice. &#34;I thought these were lost forever. I can&#39;t tell you what it means to me to have them back.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">23</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Realizing that they had uncovered a hidden treasure after all, Samuel smiled widely at his sister.</p></div></div>",

A special valve keeps the gas from escaping from the extinguisher until the lever at the top is pressed.<br /> </p><p class=\"kds-indent\">You may have an extinguisher at home that is not filled with water.  It is essential that you have it inspected every six years.  Sometimes the gauge says the extinguisher has the right pressure and will work properly.  But, the gauge could be incorrect.  That is why an inspection is important.<br /> </p><p class=\"kds-indent\">If you ever need to use an extinguisher, remember to aim the spray of water or foam at the source of the fire.  Move the can in a back&#8211;and&#8211;forth motion, like you are sweeping.  Do not use a water&#8211;filled extinguisher for putting out electrical fires.  Use it for putting out wood or paper fires only.  Most fire extinguishers only have a small amount of substance in them.  It can be used up in seconds.  So, extinguishers are best for small fires that have not spread.  For large or fast&#8211;spreading fires, call 9&#8211;1&#8211;1 and go to a safe place.</p><p></p>",

Eating Italian food is one way that swimmer Tom Dolan gears up for a big race&#8212;along with making sure his inhaler is full.  Tom has a case of asthma that might prevent some people from walking down the street, but he has won two gold medals and has broken a world record.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">2</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Tom Dolan started swimming at age five, simply to prove that he could out-swim his older sister.  He has always been highly competitive; when he was a child, his dad could always get him to drink an extra glass of milk by filling two glasses and challenging Tom to a race.  At the age of eleven, he broke his arm and his mother told him to stop swimming until the cast was off.  Instead, Tom covered the cast with a foam casing and kept on swimming.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">3</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>When Tom was twelve, he was running on the playground and suddenly felt like he could not breathe.  He did not tell his parents until it happened a second time.  They took him straight to the doctor, who diagnosed him with allergies and asthma.  Tom was allergic to dust, mold, and pollen. Worst of all for a swimmer, he was sensitive to chlorine!</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">4</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Tom&#39;s asthma did not stop him from becoming a competitive swimmer in college though, nor did the fact that he was also diagnosed with exercise&#8211;induced asthma.  This meant that his asthma would get worse as he worked out more intensely.  Another doctor said he also had a condition called tracheal stenosis, a narrow windpipe.  Due to the tracheal stenosis and asthma, Tom could only take in about 10% as much oxygen as his competitors.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">5</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Despite his medical conditions, Tom continued to swim.  His best event was the 400&#8211;meter Individual Medley (IM), which consists of 100 meters each of four different strokes: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle.  Sometimes Tom blacked out during practice, but never during a race.  Even a collapse and subsequent hospitalization in Hawaii during his sophomore year in college did not stop Tom.  He had his eye on the Olympics.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">6</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>The Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 presented Tom with a special challenge.  The heat and humidity created sticky, heavy air that made it more difficult than usual for him to breathe.  Going into the last 50 meters of the 400&#8211;meter IM, Tom was 3/100<sup>ths</sup> of a second behind his toughest competition, Eric Namesnik, another American swimmer.  Tom pushed himself to the limit, beating Eric by 35/100<sup>ths</sup> of a second and setting a world record for the event.  He went on to win his second gold medal in the same event in Sydney in 2000.</p></div><div class=\"p-number\">7</div><div class=\"numbered-paragraph\"><p>Tom believes that he is a great swimmer because of, not in spite of, his medical problems.  He feels that his asthma taught him how to overcome adversity.  As he says, he feels like he is one step ahead, because &#34;I know that my body has gone through more stress and strain than anyone else in the pool.&#34;  And, quite possibly, more Italian food.</p></div></div>",

              "text": "<h3>The Sneaky Leprechaun</h3><p class=\"kds-indent\">One beautiful day while running through a garden, a young leprechaun named Pat came across a tall, stunning waterfall. He watched as the cool water glistened in the sunlight as it fell into the pool below. Just then, a rainbow appeared right before his eyes! &#34;Wow, I bet there is a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow!&#34; he said. Without another thought, Pat jumped onto the rainbow and slid all the way down to the pond, ending with a splash. Pat landed in the crystal clear water, but there was no gold to be seen. &#34;I was wrong, there is no gold here, but only I know that...&#34; Pat let out a conniving laugh as he headed back to see his brother, Lucky.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">&#34;Lucky, I found a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, come quick!&#34; Lucky was excited and quickly followed Pat back to the top of the waterfall.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">&#34;The gold is down there?&#34; asked Lucky.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">&#34;Yes, you must slide down the rainbow to see the pot of gold,&#34; replied Pat. Lucky glided down the rainbow, reached the water below with a loud plop, and eagerly looked around. As he did this, Pat laughed deviously. &#34;I can&#39;t believe you fell for that one! I tricked you, there is no gold!&#34; Pat laughed until he could barely breathe, but Lucky did not think it was a funny joke. Lucky walked away angrily, his clothes dripping wet.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">&#34;Pat, one day you will tell the truth and no one will believe you.&#34; he said in a low, disappointed tone.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Pat disregarded Lucky&#39;s comments and continued to play practical jokes on other leprechauns in the garden. A few weeks later, Pat came across an old, long wooden bridge. As he crossed it, he saw a colorful rainbow emerge from the bright blue sky. The rainbow led from the highest clouds all the way to the ground below the bridge. As he stared down from the bridge, Pat thought he saw something shining on the ground below. He gazed until his eyes fixed onto a bowl&#8211;like object filled with something. &#34;It is, that is a pot of gold!&#34; Pat looked around, frantically looking for a way to get down to the gold. It was a very far drop to the ground from where he stood on the old bridge, and he knew he needed help. As fast as he could, Pat ran home to get Lucky.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">When Pat told Lucky what he had discovered, Lucky replied &#34;No way, I am not falling for that again!&#34;</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Pat pleaded with Lucky to believe him. &#34;I promise I am telling the truth this time, there really is a pot of gold!&#34; Lucky still did not trust him. After what felt like hours, Lucky became so annoyed with Pat that he finally agreed to follow him to the old bridge. When they arrived, the beautiful rainbow was gone and to Pat&#39;s dismay, so was the pot of gold. Pat looked down in disappointment, but a moment later something shiny caught his eye. Something was stuck in the mud just a few feet from where he stood. He walked over, picked it up, and rinsed it off in the pond. &#34;Look, I found one gold coin, I told you there was gold here!&#34; said Pat.</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Lucky gazed at his brother and then at the coin and said, &#34;If only you had always told the truth...I would have believed you sooner!&#34;</p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Pat replied, &#34;You are right, I am sorry Lucky.&#34;</p><p></p>",

They hatch into water as tadpoles which have gills and a small tail to help them swim. At this point, they are basically small fish. Soon, tadpoles begin to transform. They start to grow legs, and lungs begin to develop so they can breathe out of water.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">At 9 weeks old, the tadpole looks more like a frog than a tadpole. The whole metamorphosis is complete at 16 weeks. This is when the frog is an adult and lives out of the water.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"kds-indent\">Amphibians are very interesting and incredible creatures.</p><p></p>",
